 * A `TimelineChart` is a data visualization chart that can be used to represent
 * Gantt charts or any other timeline-based visualizations. The component has a
 * rich set of various properties that allows the user to:
 * * Zoom the chart body to see the visualizations clearer using the mouse wheel.
 * * Pan the zoomed chart horizonatally by holding down the left click button.
 * * Add annotations to highlight or illustrate different points on the timeline.
 * * Use annotations to create custom Timeline visualizations.
 * * Choose whether the timeline is discrete or continous.
 * * Show relationships between different items on the timeline using different
 * connections.
